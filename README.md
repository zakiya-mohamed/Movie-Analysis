Understanding Movies through Multi-Modal Data Analysis

Studying movies via multiple modalities including metadata, visual, audio, and textual. The series of
notebooks provides demonstration of the usage of machine learning algorithms, NLP, and various 
Python modules to analyse the various aspects present in movies.

**Data pre-processing**: Movie footages, movie posters, and movie subtitles are downloaded directly, while 
movie audio and movie text are extracted from movie footages and movie subtitles respectively using 
external Python modules

The following movie aspects are studied in detail:

1) **Visual Features**
- Movie poster colour palettes (frame level features)
- Motion detection

2) **Audio Features**
- Audio waveforms
- Audio RMS and loudness

3) **Textual Features**
- Sentiment analysis 
- Word cloud

Code output is shown in the attached notebook files. Notebooks where output is saved into system, 
additional images are attached and can be viewed separately.

*Note: Code that is adopted from existing code is referenced within the notebook (where
necessary)*
