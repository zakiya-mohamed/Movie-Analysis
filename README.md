# Movie-Analysis
Understanding Movies through Multi-Modal Data Analysis

Studying movies via multiple modalities including metadata, visual, audio, and textual. The series of
Jupyter notebooks provides demonstration of the usage of machine learning algorithms, NLP, and Python 
modules to analyse the various aspects present in movies.

1) **Visual Features**
- Colour palettes (frame level features only)

2) **Audio Features**
- Audio waveform
- Audio spectrogram

3) **Textual Features**
- Sentiment analysis (.srt file)
- Word cloud (.txt file)

Code output is shown in the Jupyter notebooks. Notebooks where output is saved into system, additional
images are attached and can be viewed separately.

**Note: Code that is adopted from existing code is referenced within the Jupyter notebook (where
necessary)
